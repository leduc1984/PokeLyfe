PokeLyfe
========

I didn't choose the PokeLyfe.  The PokeLyfe chose me.

The ultimate goal of this project is to be a multi-player, in-browser
RPG in the style of Pokemon Stadium.  I envision little characters
walking around an HTML5 canvas talking to each other and challenging
each other to battles.  The server-side is [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), and the client-side
uses the [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/)
JavaScript libraries.

This project is hosted on [Heroku](http://polar-scrubland-3999.herokuapp.com/home)
if you want to see it in action.
